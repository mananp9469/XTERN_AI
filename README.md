# README for Food Order Prediction System Xtern AI

An overview of the code used to develop a meal order prediction system is given in this README. The system uses student data analysis to forecast food orders based on a number of factors. The code also covers the use of data, model predictions, and the development of an AI-based system for predicting food orders, along with ethical, commercial, and technological issues. The primary sections are as follows:

Code Description
The code in this repository performs the following tasks:

Pie Chart Visualization: It makes a pie chart to show how the food orders are distributed. By examining the 'Order' column in the dataset, the method offers an understanding of how meal orders are distributed across various products.

Chi-Square Test: The code uses chi-square tests to evaluate the association between the target variable, order, and four predictor variables: major, year, university, and time. The relevance and significance of these factors in predicting food orders are ascertained using the chi-square testing.

Ethical, Business, and Technical viewpoints: In addition to covering business and technical viewpoints, the code also addresses ethical issues pertaining to data collecting, storage, and biases. Data security, bias and fairness, privacy, and other issues are covered.

Model Predictions and Results: It describes how to set up, train, and assess machine learning models for predicting food orders. It focuses on leveraging Python modules and tools particularly for model creation, training, and evaluation.
Findings: The code shows the better accuracy of the XGBOOST model and offers insights into model performance. Then, it informs choices on whether to develop an AI-based system for predicting food orders by taking into account variables including the volume and quality of data, the difficulty of the task, the effectiveness of the model, and ethical issues.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Stresses the need of adhering to data privacy and food safety rules as well as legal and regulatory requirements.

Company Strategy and Risk Assessment: Describes risk assessment, including possible risks and mitigation strategies, and emphasizes the significance of matching the AI solution with the company's goals and strategy.
